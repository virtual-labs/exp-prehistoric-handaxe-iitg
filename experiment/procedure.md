#### Procedure

The tool used as a sample here is an Acheulean Handaxe. Acheulian tools have been found in sites dating between 800,000 and 200,000 years ago. They have been found with the remains of H.erectus, the hominid generally credited with producing them.

The Acheulian is named after the town of St. Acheul, France, where some of the first finds were made. Acheulian tools were produced by percussion flaking. Most characteristic of the Acheulian is the handaxe, a sharp, bifacially flaked stone shaped like a large almond, which would been effective for a variety of chopping and cutting tasks. The handaxe was fashioned by removing many flakes to produce a specific form. In other words, the toolmaker had to be picture a specific shape in a stone.
